# My notes for explaining why the world needs Bitcoin to my parents

By popular demand on Twitter, I'm just digitizing my handwritten notes as seen on
the picture in the tweet
[https://twitter.com/gugol/status/1097147154819371008](https://twitter.com/gugol/status/1097147154819371008).

These notes served me as a mental guide through all the topics I wanted to touch in my talk.

Most of the ideas are based on Saifedean Ammous' book
["The Bitcoin Standard"](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861).

## Why this talk
* I don't want you to buy
* I want you to understand, what's coming

## Bitcoin
* The three most important properties of Bitcoin are:
  * It's not inflatable
  * It's not confiscable
  * It's not censorable
* I'm going to explain now why these are important

## What is money?
* Why does money have value? Why do we give it value?
* Why do banks hold gold?
* Example of glass beads in west Africa (-> see The Bitcoin Standard)
* Example of billionaire investing in copper (-> see The Bitcoin Standard)
* Why is gold different from other metals?
* But mining gold is very dirty, dangerous, poisonous and uses extreme amounts of energy
* Conclusion: The stock-to-flow ratio is important!
* Explain the gold standard and how it worked until World War 1

## What's happening now? What are the implications of abandoning the gold standard?
* Financial "islands" of countries/regions with different fiat money
* No coupling of exchange rates, highly volatile
  * Forex trading is 25x of world GDP ($1860 trillion per year vs. $75 trillion world GDP in 2016)
  * This trading offers no real value to the world apart from dealing with volatility
* Every country wants to inflate their currency but are displeased when other countries do the same
* The whole economy runs on debt (government debt as well as consumer credits)
* It's a gigantic house of cards
* The collapse is near, even "experts" speak of "when" not "if"

## So what's different in Bitcoin?
* There is a hard inflation schedule programmed into Bitcoin that cannot be altered or influenced.
* No matter how many miners there are, the amount of Bitcoins in existence cannot be increased above the
  schedule (the creation schedule can only be marginally sped up until the difficulty adjustment kicks in).

## So why do we need Bitcoin?
* Take away the money printing press from the government
* Separate the state from money (as the printing press separated state and religion and the internet separated
  state and information)
* Go back to pure capitalism, abandon the destructive consumerism

## Facts about Bitcoin
* Tell analogy "Our water is drugged" (this is my personal analogy, I'll publish it in an article soon!)
* Divisibility (8 decimal places)
* Scalability (Lightning Network)
* Sovereign individual / be your own bank
* 100% verification, 0% trust

## Myths
* "Waste" of energy
* Money for criminals
* Volatility

## Bonus topics if there is still time
* Why cashless society is bad on fiat
* Why 2008 was the birth year of Bitcoin
* How exactly does Proof-of-Work work?
* Bitcoin as a new form of life (-> see Ralph Merkle)
