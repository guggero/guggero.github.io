# "Our drinking water is drugged" - an analogy

During my (2+ years and ongoing) journey to understanding Bitcoin I've come across several independent
books/ideas/initiatives that share the sentiment that the (financial) world is broken and needs to be fixed.

When reading these texts (two of them are specifically referenced further below), I was usually surprised
how well and accurate they describe the problems our society has developed because of the inflationary monetary
policies adopted by all countries in the 20<sup>th</sup> century.  
The texts usually also pinpoint the suspected cause (inflation) of the problems.

But when the conclusion or even solution is proposed, I'm almost always disappointed.
For a moment, I almost expect the texts to mention Bitcoin as a solution.  
But then they go on and suggest either something not consequent or effective enough or something that only works
in a society that is already free of human greed.

To explain how Bitcoin is different from these proposed "solutions" and to be better able to discuss these points
with the promoters of mentioned texts, I have come up with following analogy:

## The drug

Imagine for a moment that you live in a world, where all the drinking water is artificially polluted with a highly
addictive drug. You just found that out by reading books that have never been suggested in school.  
But apparently it is not a big secret, all the "experts" agree that this increases the productivity of humans.
The drug is needed to keep society going. People consume more water because of the drug and that is good for
the economy, so the government tries to collect and bring into circulation as much water as it can to boost the economy.

And people normally don't even think about the fact that their drinking water is drugged anyway because they are too
busy worrying if they have enough water for the month. Whether their neighbor has more water than them.
If they could get more water if they worked harder. Whether it's fair that big company owners get way more
water than they could ever drink in their lifetime. What would happen to them if they lost their jobs and they
didn't get any more water.

You ask yourself: How is it, that nobody sees the audacity of this?

 While trying to figure out if you are the only person who seems to care about the water being drugged
 you find out that there is a whole community which doesn't use government-provided tap water at all.  
 They use and provide building instructions for simple devices that you can build with household items that
 produce clean, drug-free drinking water by extracting it from the air and ground around you. They call their devices "BitTap".
 
 Of course the government and large water treatment companies are not happy about that independent form of water production.  
 They try spreading lies about BitTap. They say the water it produces is toxic in the long run. They say that BitTap
 destroys the environment. Because they cannot verify these lies for themselves, most people choose to believe them
 and therefore never even try BitTap.

## The initiative

You research this topic further and find out that the country that started drugging their water last of all, recently had
a large petition going on that lead to an referendum. The people of this direct democracy were then able to vote if
they wanted to restrict _who_ was allowed to drug the water and _what quantity of drugs they were allowed to add_.  
The initiative was not successful, only about 26% of the voters voted yes. So no laws were changed based on the initiative.

## The book

People start noticing your quest for more information. A friend of yours hands you a book and asks you to read it.  
You do so and are quite surprised at first. The first half of the book describes pretty well what the problem with the
water is and how it contaminates society. But then in the second half, the book suggests a solution that has nothing to
do with BitTap at all. The book states that if you have some water left at the end of the month you can extract a tiny amount of
an antidote out of it. This antidote neutralizes some of the effects of the drug but has a lot of secondary effects.  
The antidote has to be taken continuously over a longer period to be effective.
And only those with enough water left at the end of the month are able to distill it.  
This means, society is dependent on those who have more than they need to be generous enough to give away their surplus water.  
You decide that this can't work at large scale and does not eliminate the problem at all.  

## Conclusion

You conclude that there still is hope for humanity. The fact that there are a lot of people thinking about the problem gives
you courage to continue down the rabbit hole. Even if some of the proposed solutions are not nearly enough to change the world
it still exposes more and more people to a different school of thought. You hope that showing more and more people the problem,
some of them will find BitTap on their own.
