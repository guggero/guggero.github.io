# "Our drinking water is drugged" - an analogy

During my (2+ year and ongoing) journey to understanding Bitcoin I've come across several independent
books/ideas/iniciatives that share the sentiment that the (financial) world is broken and needs to be fixed.

When reading these texts (two of them are specifically referenced further below), I was usually surprised
how well and accurate they describe the problems our society has developed because of the inflationary monetary
policies adopted by all countries in this century.  
The texts usually also pinpoint the suspected cause (inflation) of the problems.

But when the conclusion or even solution is proposed, I'm almost always disappointed.
For a moment, I almost expect the texts to mention Bitcoin as a solution.   
But then they go on and suggest either something not consequent or effective enough or something that only works
in a society that is already free of human greed.

To explain how Bitcoin is different from these proposed "solutions" and to be better able to discuss these points
with the promoters of mentioned texts, I have come up with following analogy:

## The drug

Imagine for a moment that you live in a world, where all the drinking water is artificially polluted with a highly
addictive drug. You just found that out by reading books that have never been suggested in school.  
But apparently it is not a big secret, all the experts agree that it increases the productivity of humans.
The drug is needed to keep society going. People consume more water because of the drug and that is good for
the economy.  
So people normally don't even think about the fact that their drinking water is drugged because they are too
busy worrying if they have enough water for the month. Whether their neighbor has more water than them.
If they could get more water if they worked harder. Whether it's fair that big company owners get way more
water than they could ever drink in their lifetime. What would happen to them if they lost their jobs and they
didn't get any more water.

You ask yourself: How is it, that nobody sees the audacity of this?
