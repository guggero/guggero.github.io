This is work in progress!

My goal is to provide arguments as to why I think private/permissioned blockchains are useless and a hype.

## ideology

### public blockchain
* open, borderless, global, permissionless, uncensorable
* real democracy in technology
* freedom vs. efficiency

### private blockchain
* intranet, disney version of the internet. because the internet is scary
* AOL, Compuserve, walled gardens
* transport hype words instead of what really makes it special
  * encryption, signatures, tamper proof, smart contracts (web: linked data, everything accessible, standardized representation)
  * vs.
  * everybody can participate; democratisation of money (web: democratisation of knowledge)
* boring, not interesting in the broader sense

## technology

### public blockchain
* security through external energy introduced into closed system
* trust in no entity
* financial incentive to participate

### private blockchain
* security through central authority
* trust in one or few entities
* without currency on top, the blockchain story falls apart
* no incentive for anyone to participate other than promises by consortium

## conclusions

* DDBMS have existed for ages

* consortium: trusting a few is not better than trusting one
* public data vs. data protection: if you need a central database to map the blockchain IDs to real world IDs, the distribution falls apart
